  <h2>What is workout?</h2>
  <p>
    Workout is a session of physical activities or exercises done to improve health,
    fitness, or strength. Workouts can include cardio exercises like running or cycling,
    strength training with weights, flexibility exercises like stretching or yoga, and 
    balance or coordination activities. Regular workouts help maintain a healthy body 
    weight, strengthen muscles, improve heart and lung function, boost mood, and increase 
    energy levels. It is important to combine different types of exercises and rest properly 
    to avoid injury and achieve better results.
